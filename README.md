Predicting New York City Yellow Taxi Fare Using Some Machine Learning Models

Welcome to New York City! üóΩ
Getting into a taxi in an unfamiliar city can be nerve-wracking. You have no idea how much the trip should cost or if the driver is taking the most direct route. In New York City, taxi riders cannot get an advance estimate for taxi fares. The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission‚Äôs official stance is that ‚Äúit is impossible to pre-calculate a fare because the meter rate depends on traffic, construction, weather, and route to the destination.‚Äù

In New York City, taxicabs come in two varieties: yellow and green; they are widely recognizable symbols of the city. Taxis painted yellow (medallion taxis) are able to pick up passengers anywhere in the five boroughs. Green Boro Taxis, which operate in the outer boroughs and parts of Manhattan north of certain streets, can either be prearranged or hailed on the street. Both types have the same fare structure. Taxicabs are operated by private companies and licensed by the (TLC).
